### Michelle Orru
### Description: 

This program will compare the effeciently of two different data structures, AVL trees and Linked Lists. The program will load 100,000 data points from a json file into a vector then place them into a Singly Linked list and 8 different AVL trees that searches and adds based on different criteria. Then it will search for specfic pieces of data in both data structures and times how long it took to access the data in both.
